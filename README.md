# marble_ray_tracer
A Webassembly marble game in Rust

The intention of this project was to get a ray tracer running in webassmebly to replicate Marble Madness. My hope was that the ray tracing would allow fancy rendering like reflections and transparency while the webassembly and limit scope of marbles and a floor would allow for a high frame rate. However, after trying it out, the frame rate at my target resolution wasn't high enough to meet my expectations.
